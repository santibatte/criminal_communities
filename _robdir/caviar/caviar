In this problem, you will study a time-varying criminal network that is repeatedly disturbed by police forces. The data for this problem can be found in the CAVIAR directory of the data archive.

The CAVIAR investigation lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. The operation brought together investigation units of the Montréal police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada. During this two year period, 11 wiretap warrants, valid for a period of about two months each, were obtained (the 11 matrices contained in phase1.csv, phase2.csv, … correspond to these eleven, two month wiretap phases).

This case is interesting because, unlike other investigative strategies, the mandate of the CAVIAR project was to seize the drugs without arresting the perpetrators. During this period, imports of the trafficking network were hit by the police on eleven occasions. The arrests took place only at the end of the investigation. Monetary losses for traffickers were estimated at 32 million dollars. Eleven seizures took place throughout the investigation. Some phases included no seizures, and others included multiple. The following summarizes the 11 seizures:

Phase 4	1 seizure	$2,500,000	300 kg of marijuana
Phase 6	3 seizures	$1,300,000	2 x 15 kg of marijuana + 1 x 2 kg of cocaine
Phase 7	1 seizure	$3,500,000	401 kg of marijuana
Phase 8	1 seizure	$360,000	9 kg of cocaine
Phase 9	2 seizures	$4,300,000	2 kg of cocaine + 1 x 500 kg marijuana
Phase 10	1 seizure	$18,700,000	2200 kg of marijuana
Phase 11	2 seizures	$1,300,000	12 kg of cocaine + 11 kg of cocaine


This case offers a rare opportunity to study a criminal network in upheaval from police forces. This allows us to analyze changes in the network structure and to survey the reaction and adaptation of the participants while they were subjected to an increasing number of distressing constraints.

The network consists of 110 (numbered) players. Players 1-82 are the traffickers. Players 83-110 are the non-traffickers (financial investors; accountants; owners of various importation businesses, etc.). Initially, the investigation targeted Daniel Serero, the alleged mastermind of a drug network in downtown Montréal, who attempted to import marijuana to Canada from Morocco, transiting through Spain. After the first seizure, happening in Phase 4, traffickers reoriented to cocaine import from Colombia, transiting through the United States.

According to the police, the role of 23 of the players in the “Serero organization" are the following, listed by name (unique id):

Daniel Serero (n1) : Mastermind of the network.

Pierre Perlini (n3) : Principal lieutenant of Serero, he executes Serero's instructions.

Alain (n83) and Gérard (n86) Levy : Investors and transporters of money.

Wallace Lee (n85) : Takes care of financial affairs (accountant).

Gaspard Lino (n6): Broker in Spain.

Samir Rabbat (n11): Provider in Morocco.

Lee Gilbert (n88): Trusted man of Wallace Lee (became an informer after the arrest).

Beverly Ashton (n106): Spouse of Lino, transports money and documents.

Antonio Iannacci (n89): Investor.

Mohammed Echouafni (n84): Moroccan investor.

Richard Gleeson (n5), Bruno de Quinzio (n8) and Gabrielle Casale (n76) : Charged with recuperating the marijuana.

Roderik Janouska (n77): Individual with airport contacts.

Patrick Lee (n87): Investor.

Salvatore Panetta (n82): Transport arrangements manager.

Steve Cunha (n96): Transport manager, owner of a legitimate import company (became an informer after the arrest).

Ernesto Morales (n12): Principal organizer of the cocaine import, intermediary between the Colombians and the Serero organization.

Oscar Nieri (n17): The handyman of Morales.

Richard Brebner (n80): Was transporting the cocaine from the US to Montréal.

Ricardo Negrinotti (n33): Was taking possession of the cocaine in the US to hand it to Brebner.

Johnny Pacheco (n16): Cocaine provider.

In the data files (phase1.csv, phase2.csv, …), you will find matrices that report the number of wiretapped correspondences between the above players in the network, where players are identified by their unique id. You will be analyzing this time-varying network, giving a rough sketch of its shape, its evolution and the role of the actors in it.

You can also load this dataset directly from the internet (which is slightly more convenient when using Colab) using the following Python code:

import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
phases = {}
G = {}
for i in range(1,12): 
  var_name = "phase" + str(i)
  file_name = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragini30/Networks-Homework/main/" + var_name + ".csv"
  phases[i] = pd.read_csv(file_name, index_col = ["players"])
  phases[i].columns = "n" + phases[i].columns
  phases[i].index = phases[i].columns
  G[i] = nx.from_pandas_adjacency(phases[i])
  G[i].name = var_name
Note that this code also renames the actors from integer identifiers to strings of the kind “n1", “n2" etc, to be more consistent with notation. It then creates networkx graphs from the matrices and stores them in the G dictionary by their phase number.
